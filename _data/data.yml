    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Young and promising venezuelan physicist, got my master degree in Theoretical Physics at the Universität Bonn.

      My main passions are Theoretical Physics and drinking bubble tea, so it's no wonder that my favorite activity is solving 1000000-dimentional tensorial equations while gulping copious ammounts of bubble tea.

      I serve the soviet union! ☭
